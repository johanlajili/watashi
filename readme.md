# Watashi - A language learning tool using GPT-3.5, free and open source

I'll upload the code soon enough, but since people registered their interest, here is an overview

Watashi offers
- A game like experience, similar to phoenix wright
- Multiple user created scenarios, such as renting an appartment, going to the doctor etc.
- Each scenario can have multiple scenes, with key condition to meet to allow the user to go from one scene to the next. For instance, you need to be able to explain what sort of flat you are after to be taken to visit some flats.
- The scenarios are written using State Machines, with each scene being a node with its own background, prompt and conditions to go to another scene.

The game is written in TypeScript and NodeJS.

### Open Source Goals
- I'm hoping to create something like "Stepmania" or "Osu" where users create their own scenarios and add them to a global bank of scenarios that can be rated and downloaded by other users.
- It will be free but require to input your own OpenAI key when starting it. However from my own use it costs litteral cents to run.
- For now I would focus on language learning, and specifically in Japanese, but it could be extended to other languages, or even other use case altogether, like a simple role playing game.
